Companies that fail to recognize their workers through some type of acknowledgement and/or reward end-up damaging employee morale, productivity, and retention (<a href="https://www.business2community.com/human-resources/10-employee-recognition-stats-cant-ignore-01878458" target="_blank">Heller, 2017</a>).
