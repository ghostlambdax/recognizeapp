<p>The role of human resources (HR) has definitely been in flux over the past decade. While once regarded as an administrative team with little to no business ties, the perception of HR has since changed. This department has been <strong>transformed from a traditional paper pusher to a full-fledged workplace business partner</strong> especially in recent years (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylesmith/2013/04/04/its-time-for-companies-to-fire-their-human-resource-departments/#273f54de2070" target="_blank">Smith, 2013</a>). And as more and more industries adapt to changing technology and employee expectations, HR must reinvent itself as well in order to help companies remain cutting-edge and survive the ongoing war on talent (<a href="https://www.bamboohr.com/blog/13-hr-trends-stats-to-surprise-you/" target="_blank">De Luca, 2018</a>). So there has been an increasing push to optimize HR to help companies better manage their human capital.</p>
